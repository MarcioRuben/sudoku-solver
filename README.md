# Description
In this project we use OpenCV in python to be able to capture a video using our webcam or any other camera (eg. IPwebcam), and solve the sudoku that's presented to us right away.

## Explanation
We'll point the camera to an image of an unsolved sudoku. After that, the program will be able to identify the numbers in the table and then it'll just fill the empty spaces in the live video, with the number in the correct position of the solved sudoku.
